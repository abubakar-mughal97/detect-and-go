# Detect and Go (ROS 2)

This project integrates **YOLO-based object detection** with a **mobile robot in ROS 2 and Gazebo**.  
The robot detects objects in its environment and moves towards them, combining **computer vision** and **robot navigation**.

## Features
- Object detection using YOLO
- Integration with ROS 2 (Jazzy)
- Simulation in Gazebo
- Basic navigation towards detected objects
